  abstract =	 {We present mid-infrared photometry of the Orion bar
                  obtained with the Faint Object infraRed Camera for
                  the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) on board SOFIA at 6.4,
                  6.6, 7.7, 19.7, 31.5, and 37.1 mum. By complementing
                  this observation with archival FORCAST and
                  Herschel/PACS images, we are able to construct a
                  complete infrared spectral energy distribution of
                  the Huygens region in the Orion nebula. Comparing
                  the infrared images with gas tracers, we find that
                  PACS maps trace the molecular cloud, while the
                  FORCAST data trace the photodissociation region
                  (PDR) and the H II region. Analysis of the
                  energetics of the region reveal that the PDR extends
                  for 0.28 pc along the line of sight and that the bar
                  is inclined at an angle of 4°. The infrared and
                  submillimeter images reveal that the Orion bar
                  represents a swept-up shell with a thickness of 0.1
                  pc. The mass of the shell implies a shock velocity
                  of ~=3 km s-1 and an age of ~=105 years for the H II
                  region. Our analysis shows that the UV and infrared
                  dust opacities in the H II region and the PDR are a
                  factor 5 to 10 lower than in the diffuse
                  interstellar medium. In the ionized gas, Lyalpha
                  photons are a major source of dust heating at
                  distances larger than ~=0.06 pc from theta 1 Ori C.
                  Dust temperatures can be explained if the size of
                  the grains is between 0.1 and 1 mum. We derive the
                  photoelectric heating efficiency of the atomic gas
                  in the Orion bar. The results are in good
                  qualitative agreement with models and the
                  quantitative differences indicate a decreased
                  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon abundance in this
                  region.},

  abstract =	 {We present new deep near-infrared images of dark
                  clouds in the Perseus molecular complex. These
                  images show beautiful extended emission that we
                  model as scattered ambient starlight and name
                  ``cloudshine.'' The brightness and color variation
                  of cloudshine complicates the production of
                  extinction maps, the best tracer of column density
                  in clouds. However, since the profile of reflected
                  light is essentially a function of mass
                  distribution, cloudshine provides a new way to study
                  the structure of dark clouds. Previous work has used
                  optical scattered light to study the density profile
                  of tenuous clouds; extending this technique into the
                  infrared provides a high-resolution view into the
                  interiors of very dense clouds, bypassing the
                  complexities of using thermal dust emission, which
                  is biased by grain temperature, or molecular
                  tracers, which have complicated depletion patterns.
                  As new wide-field infrared cameras are used to study
                  star-forming regions at greater depth, cloudshine
                  will be widely observed and should be seen as a new
                  high-resolution tool, rather than an inconvenience.},

@article{Abel:2006a,
  abstract =	 {Orion's Veil is an absorbing screen that lies along
                  the line of sight to the Orion H II region. It
                  consists of two or more layers of gas that must lie
                  within a few parsecs of the Trapezium cluster. Our
                  previous work considered the Veil as a whole and
                  found that the magnetic field dominates the
                  energetics of the gas in at least one component.
                  Here we use high-resolution STIS UV spectra that
                  resolve the two velocity components in absorption
                  and determine the conditions in each. We derive a
                  volume hydrogen density, 21 cm spin temperature,
                  turbulent velocity, and kinetic temperature for
                  each. We combine these estimates with magnetic field
                  measurements to find that magnetic energy
                  significantly dominates turbulent and thermal
                  energies in one component, while the other component
                  is close to equipartition between turbulent and
                  magnetic energies. We observe H2 absorption for
                  highly excited v, J levels that are photoexcited by
                  the stellar continuum, and detect blueshifted S+2
                  and P+2 ions. These ions must arise from ionized gas
                  between the mostly neutral portions of the Veil and
                  the Trapezium and shields the Veil from ionizing
                  radiation. We find that this layer of ionized gas is
                  also responsible for He I lambda3889 absorption
                  toward the Veil, which resolves a 40 year old debate
                  on the origin of He I absorption toward the
                  Trapezium. Finally, we determine that the ionized
                  and mostly atomic layers of the Veil will collide in
                  less than 85,000 yr.},

  abstract =	 {The optical appearance of the Orion Nebula is
                  significantly altered by the presence of
                  interstellar extinction. Since Orion is high above
                  the Galactic plane and is nearby, most of this
                  extinction is due to material immediately in front
                  of the associated star cluster. This extinction
                  fundamentally alters the optical appearance of the
                  Orion Nebula. We have quantitatively determined the
                  extinction correction by comparing the surface
                  brightness of the nebula at a resolution of about
                  1.7" in the radio continuum and the Halpha emission
                  line. The results compare well with new
                  determinations made from Halpha and Hbeta line
                  ratios. Extinction-corrected optical images are
                  generated and discussed. The most important
                  extinction feature, the dark bay that obscures the
                  east side of the nebula, has a mass of about 3
                  Msolar and possesses numerous small knots of
                  material in addition to a feature that appears to be
                  a shock. We also find that the thin main emitting
                  layer on the front of the parent Orion molecular
                  cloud is marked by numerous walls and plateaus. Only
                  one such structure had been previously known, the
                  one that produces a bright bar across the southeast
                  portion of the nebula. The sharpest structure is
                  associated with the complex of molecular outflow and
                  infrared sources near the region called Orion-S and
                  is likely to be the result of uncollimated outflow
                  from an imbedded young star. Based in part on

                  cloud surface illuminated by strong ultraviolet
                  radiation from nearby massive stars. Our relative
                  closeness to the Orion nebula (about 1,350 light
                  years away from Earth) means that we can study the
                  effects of stellar feedback on the parental cloud in
                  detail. Visible-light observations of the Orion Bar
                  show that the transition between the hot ionized gas
                  and the warm neutral atomic gas (the ionization
                  front) is spatially well separated from the
                  transition between atomic and molecular gas (the
                  dissociation front), by about 15 arcseconds or 6,200
                  astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the
                  Earth-Sun distance). Static equilibrium models used
                  to interpret previous far-infrared and radio
                  observations of the neutral gas in the Orion Bar
                  (typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an
                  inhomogeneous cloud structure comprised of dense
                  clumps embedded in a lower-density extended gas
                  component. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution
                  millimetre-wave images that allow us to resolve the
                  molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary
                  model predictions, there is no appreciable offset
                  between the peak of the H<SUB>2</SUB> vibrational
                  emission (delineating the H/H<SUB>2</SUB>
                  transition) and the edge of the observed CO and
                  HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission. This implies that the
                  H/H<SUB>2</SUB> and C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO transition
                  zones are very close. We find a fragmented ridge of
                  high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows
                  and instabilities at the molecular cloud surface.
                  The results suggest that the cloud edge has been
                  compressed by a high-pressure wave that is moving
                  into the molecular cloud, demonstrating that
                  dynamical and non-equilibrium effects are important
                  for the cloud evolution.},

  abstract =	 {We have used the new 90 GHz MUSTANG camera on the
                  Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to map the
                  bright Huygens region of the star-forming region M42
                  with a resolution of 9'' and a sensitivity of 2.8
                  mJy beam-1. Ninety GHz is an interesting transition
                  frequency, as MUSTANG detects both the free-free
                  emission characteristic of the H II region created
                  by the Trapezium stars, normally seen at lower
                  frequencies, and thermal dust emission from the
                  background OMC1 molecular cloud, normally mapped at
                  higher frequencies. We also present similar data
                  from the 150 GHz GISMO camera taken on the IRAM 30 m
                  telescope. This map has 15'' resolution. By
                  combining the MUSTANG data with 1.4, 8, and 21 GHz
                  radio data from the VLA and GBT, we derive a new
                  estimate of the emission measure averaged electron
                  temperature of Te = 11376 $\pm$ 1050 K by an
                  original method relating free-free emission
                  intensities at optically thin and optically thick
                  frequencies. Combining Infrared Space
                  Observatory-long wavelength spectrometer (ISO-LWS)
                  data with our data, we derive a new estimate of the
                  dust temperature and spectral emissivity index
                  within the 80'' ISO-LWS beam toward Orion KL/BN, Td
                  = 42 $\pm$ 3 K and beta d = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.1. We show
                  that both Td and beta d decrease when going from the
                  H II region and excited OMC1 interface to the denser
                  UV shielded part of OMC1 (Orion KL/BN, Orion S).
                  With a model consisting of only free-free and
                  thermal dust emission, we are able to fit data taken
                  at frequencies from 1.5 GHz to 854 GHz (350 mum).},

                  possibly related to Barnard's Loop, (ii) an arc in

                  of a large, expanding H I shell noted by Heiles, and

@article{van-der-Werf:2013a,
  abstract =	 {We present H I 21 cm observations of the Orion
                  Nebula, obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
                  Array, at an angular resolution of 7.''2 × 5.''7 and
                  a velocity resolution of 0.77 km s-1. Our data
                  reveal H I absorption in the Veil toward the radio
                  continuum of the H II region, and H I emission
                  arising from the Orion Bar photon-dominated region
                  (PDR) and from the Orion-KL outflow. In the Orion
                  Bar PDR, the H I signal peaks in the same layer as
                  the H2 near-infrared vibrational line emission, in
                  agreement with models of the photodissociation of
                  H2. The gas temperature in this region is
                  approximately 540 K, and the H I abundance in the
                  interclump gas in the PDR is 5%-10% of the available
                  hydrogen nuclei. Most of the gas in this region
                  therefore remains molecular. Mechanical feedback on
                  the Veil manifests itself through the interaction of
                  ionized flow systems in the Orion Nebula, in
                  particular the Herbig-Haro object HH 202, with the
                  Veil. These interactions give rise to prominent
                  blueward velocity shifts of the gas in the Veil. The
                  unambiguous evidence for interaction of this flow
                  system with the Veil shows that the distance between
                  the Veil and the Trapezium stars needs to be revised
                  downward to about 0.4 pc. The depth of the ionized
                  cavity is about 0.7 pc, which is much smaller than
                  the depth and the lateral extent of the Veil. Our
                  results reaffirm the blister model for the M42 H II
                  region, while also revealing its relation to the
                  neutral environment on a larger scale.},
